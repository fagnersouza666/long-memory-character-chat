# GPT-5-mini Model Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of GPT-5-mini model support in the long-memory-character-chat project. The implementation follows the existing pattern for model integration, allowing users to select GPT-5-mini as either their main conversation model or summary model through the Streamlit interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Model Selection Options (app.py)
- Added "gpt-5-mini" to both the main model and summary model selectors in the Streamlit UI
- Main Models now include:
  - gemini-2.5-flash
  - gpt-4o-mini
  - gpt-5-mini
  - mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
  - claude-3-haiku-20240307
  - meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free
- Summary Models now include:
  - gemini-2.5-flash
  - claude-3-haiku-20240307
  - gpt-4o-mini
  - gpt-5-mini

### 2. Updated Label Formatting (app.py)
- Added "GPT 5 mini" label for "gpt-5-mini" model in the format_model_label function
- This provides a user-friendly display name in the UI

### 3. Backend Compatibility
- No changes were required in aiagent.py since the existing OpenAI API integration already supports GPT models through the condition `"gpt" in self.model`
- The GPT-5-mini model will automatically be routed to the OpenAI API client when selected

## Technical Details
- The implementation leverages the existing OpenAI integration pattern
- No changes to data models were required
- No additional security considerations were needed
- Performance characteristics will depend on the GPT-5-mini model's specifications

## Testing
- Verified that GPT-5-mini appears in both model selection radio buttons in the UI
- Confirmed that the model label displays correctly as "GPT 5 mini"
- The backend implementation follows the existing proven pattern for GPT models

## Future Considerations
- When GPT-5-mini becomes available, actual API calls should work without further code modifications
- Cost tracking for GPT-5-mini may need to be added to the [count_cost](file:///C:/Projetos/long-memory-character-chat/aiagent.py#L421-L486) function if its pricing differs from existing GPT models
